Demos include

1. A demonstration of why most published research findings are false. `See demo <https://lawsofthought.shinyapps.io/false_discovery>`__.
2. A demonstration of how p-hacking can lead to significant results. `See demo <https://lawsofthought.shinyapps.io/p_hacking>`__.
3. A demonstration of how optional stopping can inflate Type I error rates. `See demo <https://lawsofthought.shinyapps.io/optional_stopping>`__.
4. A demonstration of how lower powered studies can inflate the value of true effects. `See demo <https://lawsofthought.shinyapps.io/power_failure>`__.

:Note: To use shinyapps.io, I had to install package PKI and this lead to errors when I tried to install the usual way. This was fixed with

.. code::

     install.packages('PKI',,'http://www.rforge.net/')
