Some shiny app demos related to the psychology replication crisis
=================================================================

Demos include

1. A demonstration of why most published research findings are false.
2. A demonstration of how p-hacking can lead to significant results.
3. A demonstration of how optional stopping can inflate Type I error rates.
4. A demonstration of how lower powered studies can inflate the value of true effects.

## Note

To use shinyapps.io, I had to install package PKI and this lead to errors when I tried to install the usual way. This was fixed with

.. code::

     install.packages('PKI',,'http://www.rforge.net/')
